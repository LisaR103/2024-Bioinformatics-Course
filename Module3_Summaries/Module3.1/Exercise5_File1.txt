Today is Wednesday, 10th of April 2024
This is File 1 of Exercise 5 in Module 3.1 of my Bioinformatics Course
I have to add another couple of lines to this thing.
Today the sun is shining. It is colder than it was on the weekend but still nice.
I just ate a piece of bread with Momos fabulous abricot jam :-)
