    "# SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL = Structured Query Language\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL allows to access and manipulate databases. SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, but there are different versions. The major commands are supported by all.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use MySWL workbench as GUI, but this is only one of many RBDMS (Relational Database Management System). There are different server types, I have to have the correct RBDMS to match the type of my server.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with workbench we are always connected to one server. One server can hold several databases, the databases have to match the server type. If we want to work on several databases they all have to be on the same server. It is possible to connect to different servers, just not at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I can write scripts in SQL that I can load into workbench to run. If another database has the same server type I can use these scripts (with tweaking to allow for the other database structure)\n",

    "# Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- field is the column definition, i.e. the column name, data type, rules etc. (We will call this column header and stick to field when meaning a single row/column combination)\n",
    "- record is a row (a horizontal entity in a table)\n",
    "- a column is a vertical entity in a table\n",
    "- PK as primary key and FK or MUL(?) as foreign key\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is completely case insensitive! It is convention to use all capital letters for SQL statements, but it is not a requirement for the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Statements are closed with a`;`. Everything before the `;`, even in several lines, is recognized as one statement. Indentation and linebreaks don't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We add single line comments with `-- comment` or multiline comments with `/* comment */`\n",

    "## SHOW\n",
    "\n",
    "Very handy especially for databases without a GUI, as it displays the content in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SHOW DATABASES; ` shows all databses in the system\n",
    "- `SHOW TABLES;` shows all tables in the active database\n",
    "- `SHOW TABLES dbs;` shows all tables in the database called dbs\n",
    "- `SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name;` shows all columns of the table called table_name\n",
    "\n",
    "## SELECT\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT is used to filter data from a database. The returned data is stored in a temporary result tabel = result set. SELECT works row by row\n",

    "- the table we want to get data from\n",
    "- the columns we want included in the result\n",
    "- more statements, e.g. conditions, can be added to SELECT\n",
    "- Multiple SELECT statements can be combined (sub queries) to make use of the relation between tables\n",
    "\n",
    "General Syntax:\n",
